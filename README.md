## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Version 18.x or higher recommended. (Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions).
*   **npm:** (Comes with Node.js) or Yarn/pnpm.
*   **Appwrite Instance:** You need a running Appwrite instance (Cloud or self-hosted).
*   **Google Gemini API Key:** Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone 
    cd AI_Recipes_Generator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project by copying the example below. **Never commit your `.env` file to version control!**

    ```dotenv
    # .env.example - Copy this to .env and fill in your values

    # Google Gemini API Key
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY

    # Appwrite Configuration
    VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1 # Or your self-hosted endpoint
    VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID
    VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=YOUR_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_RECIPES=YOUR_RECIPES_COLLECTION_ID
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_USER_PROFILES=YOUR_USER_PROFILES_COLLECTION_ID
    ```

    Replace the placeholder values (`YOUR_...`) with your actual credentials and IDs from Google AI Studio and your Appwrite project console.

    *   **Appwrite Setup:** Ensure you have created the necessary database and collections (`recipes`, `userProfiles`) in your Appwrite project with the appropriate attributes and permissions as implied by the `src/lib/appwrite.ts` file. The `userProfiles` collection should have attributes like `userId` (string, required, indexed), `dietaryPreferences` (string array), `cuisinePreferences` (string array), `skillLevel` (string), `darkMode` (boolean), `savedIngredients` (string array), `defaultServings` (integer), `displayName` (string), `avatarUrl` (string). Document-level permissions should allow the respective user read/write access. The `recipes` collection needs attributes matching `SavedRecipeDocument`.

### Running the Development Server

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
# or
# pnpm dev
```

The application should now be running, typically at http://localhost:8080 (as configured in vite.config.ts).

🏗️ Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
# or
# pnpm build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the dist/ directory.

⚙️ Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the application to function correctly. These should be placed in a .env file in the project root:
```bash
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY: Your API key for accessing the Google Gemini API.

VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT: The API endpoint URL for your Appwrite instance.

VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID: Your Appwrite project's unique ID.

VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID: The ID of the Appwrite database containing your collections.

VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_RECIPES: The ID of the collection used to store saved recipes.

VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_USER_PROFILES: The ID of the collection used to store user profile data and preferences.

## ☁️ Deployment

This project is built with Vite. You can deploy the static output from the `dist/` directory (after running `npm run build`) to any static hosting provider like:

*   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
*   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
*   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
*   [Render](https://render.com/)

Configure your hosting provider to serve the `index.html` file and ensure your environment variables are correctly set up in the deployment environment.

The original project scaffold might have mentioned [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/) for deployment. You can continue using that platform if preferred, following their specific deployment instructions.
